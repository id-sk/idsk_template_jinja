It can also be used with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), a Javascript templating language based on Jinja.

It's published to the [npm Registry](https://www.npmjs.org/package/idsk_template_jinja) and you can add it to your application's dependencies from there.

Please don't send pull requests here for anything but this README, send them to [idsk_template](https://github.com/id-sk/idsk_template). instead. They'll end up here when the template is updated.
